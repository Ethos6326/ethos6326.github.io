The car was driven with 2 DC motors that used tank-like movements for turning. <br />

The wiring was hidden in a 3D-printed casing. Since the LiPO was 11.1V, the Raspberry Pi had to be powered through a Buck Converter to step down the voltage. The battery was also connected to the motor controller that powered the motors. <br />
